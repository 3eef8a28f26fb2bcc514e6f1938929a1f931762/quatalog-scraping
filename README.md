# The Quatalog

The official RPI course catalog is well-known for being a garbage fire.
Just about every piece of information that it gives for a course can be inaccurate.

Oftentimes, the prerequisites are wrong, the times that the course is offered is wrong ("Spring annually"/etc),
and worst of all many courses still listed in the catalog haven't been offered in years and effectively no longer exist (e.g. [CHEM-4330](catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=24&coid=51428) hasn't been offered since 2013).

The Quatalog aims to make course planning easier by providing accurate prerequiste data and data for when a
given course was offered in the past, as well as data for how many students were enrolled in the course,
and the professor(s) teaching during a given semester. 
The name comes from [QuACS](https://github.com/quacs/quacs), which is the [source of data](https://github.com/quacs/quacs-data) for this project.

This is the main quatalog repo, which includes the data scraper (converts quacs-data into the quatalog's data format). To see the data for this project, see the [data repo](https://github.com/quatalog/data), and to see the static site, see the [site repo](https://github.com/quacs/site).
